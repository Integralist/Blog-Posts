##Introduction

Be warned: this is a long article. There was no other way to try and explain this subject. I wish I could have made it 'short and sweet' so it was easy to digest but unfortunately with this particular subject matter I needed to give as much background information as possible, otherwise I run the risk of referencing elements using terminology the reader just doesn't understand and they end up getting lost and confused.

With that in mind let's get going… 

##What's the question?

What is the best way to analyse, understand or 'handle' a given situation? 

When presented with something that can be looked at either objectively (or subjectively) you need to have the most complete understanding possible before you can accurately come to a conclusion as to the appropriate response/course of action.

To reach this goal you need to be able to look at the object from all angles, and consider all perspectives. But that alone isn't always enough. 

If the situation resolves around a person then you need a way to communicate with that person as effectively as possible. To do that you need to be able to speak their language (and by 'language' I mean you need to speak to them on their level). To do that you need to know what 'level' they're currently residing. This is where psychology comes in to try and solve the question of understanding by looking at the history of human development…

##Human development

In psychology there are many theories of human development, one popular theory is called [Spiral Dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics) which is based on associating a colour with a particular stage of human development (or 'meme' to use the relevant terminology):

Colour       | Stage
------------ | -------------
Beige        | Archaic
Purple       | Magic
Red          | Egocentric
Blue         | Mythic
Orange       | Strategic
Green        | Egalitarian

I wont go into too much detail here of what each stage means - I'll do that later when I come to discuss a more inclusive theory - but for example if we look at 'Red => Egocentric': these types of people are those you would expect to find as heads of industry (CEO's, business managers etc). These are considered to be the type of people who know what they want and will do whatever it takes to get there. For example, arguing with a 'Red' stage person will likely be a head on collision with a brick wall because they'll fight you 'tooth & nail' to hold their position and beliefs. 

Note: saying business managers are the types you'll see mostly at the Red stage isn't a pure fact. Please don't take offence if you happen to be a manager of a business and you don't feel you are 'egocentric' - this isn't to say all managers are stage Red. People in stage Red can be very driven and the majority of the time are found to be in those types of positions. But as we'll see, you'll find stage Red people in all walks of life and you'll also find people who may be higher up the ladder of human development (e.g. Green) but because of their 'shadows' (a term used in pyschoanalysis as developed by [Carl Jung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) to describe the projection of a past repressed weakness or shortcoming) can resurface when they are challenged and they force out a stage Red reaction.

##Integral Theory

Integral Theory (which utilises the [AQAL model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQAL) - as developed and popularised by the American philosopher Ken Wilber) also includes a variation of the theory of human development which is similar to Spiral Dynamics.

Their variation on the stages of human development are:

Colour       | Stage
------------ | -------------
Infrared     | Archaic
Magenta      | Magic
Red          | Power
Amber        | Mythic
Orange       | Rational
Green        | Pluralistic
Teal         | Integral

To explain these further… 

###Archaic

This stage is associated within the age range of 0-18 months and have very few needs such as: food, water, warmth, shelter. They must do what they need to survive: Un-differntiated, narcissism.

###Magic

This stage is associated within the age range of 1-3 years and is very egocentric and impulsive. Because of their egocentric nature and inability to take other perspectives, things literally appear as magic (e.g. if infront of an infant you hide behind a blanket, that infant will literally think you have disappeared as they have no concept of understanding the application of another perspective). In higher life these types of people are found in tribal communities, they believe that they should appease the Gods to keep their crops healthy, they have rituals and magical thinking.

###Power

This stage is associated within the age range of 3-6 years and is based on aggression and doing what you want regardless of consequences. Hero status is given to some in this stage. It's also aligned with power and taking what you need. It has pitfalls in later life such as: gangs, anxiety, depression, phobias, bullying, terrorism.

###Mythic

This stage is associated within the age range of 7-8 years and

###Rational

This stage is associated within the age range of 9-14 years and

###Pluralistic

This stage is associated within the age range of 15-21 years and

###Integral

This stage is

Now we know a little bit about 






What defines a person as being 'integral' and thus having an opinion that could be considered integral (meaning: unified, integrated, comprehensive, complete, whole)?

Well these queries are themselves philosophical and so the theories related to them will evolve as we progress, but at this moment in time I think the closest tool we have to ascertain an integral perspective is with what is known as the [AQAL model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQAL) which was developed and popularised by the American philosopher Ken Wilber.
